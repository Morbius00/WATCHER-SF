Watcher is a platform to prevent cheating in Google Forms by securing it with tab change detection and terminating the user's session once he crosses the click off limit.
This platform made for teachers, schools and colleges who conduct their tests/quizes via Google Forms.

# <img src="https://emojipedia-us.s3.amazonaws.com/source/microsoft-teams/337/star-struck_1f929.png" width="45"/> INSPIRATION -
* Online learning came as a boon to the students who were unable to attend normal school due to the pandemic.
* But since there are two sides to a coin, the boon soon became a curse when students started cheating in tests.
* Tests are made to assess what a student has learnt during a particular period of time, but students due to their fragile nature, started taking the easy way out by cheating and using unfair means in the tests.

# <img src="https://emojipedia-us.s3.amazonaws.com/source/microsoft-teams/337/face-with-monocle_1f9d0.png" width="43"/> WHAT IT DOES -
* Watcher is a platform to prevent cheating in Google Forms by securing it with tab change detection and terminating the student's session once he/she crosses the click off limit.
* It contains a built-in timer which terminates the form as soon the student exceeds the allotted time.
* Once on the form, the student will be presented with an instructions page (which can be customised by the teacher) in order to go about different sections of the test.
* Observing the behaviour of students we found out that students tend to take the easy way out if they have the option to do so. In this case, the "easy way" is "cheating" to pass the test. By forcing the form to be only visible in a full screen mode, we try to avoid the fragile minds of students from getting distracted.
* While filling the form, if a student opens another tab or deviates from the form, they will be warned. The warn limit on the form is 3.
* If the number of warns increases more than 3, the student's session will be terminated and since auto-save is off, all their progress will be lost.
* The session termination might also happen if the timer in the navigation menu hits 00:00, i.e., he/she exceeds the time limit.
* Once the session is terminated, the student can't fill the form again even if he reloads or goes back.
* Even if a student disables JS for the website, they won't be able to attempt the test.

* The elephant in the room is   <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/master/icons/javascript/javascript-original.svg" alt="javascript" width="20" height="20"/>  in this case. It is the script which protects the iframe from students using unfair means.
  
# <img src="https://emojipedia-us.s3.amazonaws.com/source/microsoft-teams/337/exploding-head_1f92f.png" width="43"/> CHALLANGES WE RAN INTO -
* Making the platform easy-to-use for teachers who are not so good with new tech.
* Tracking the time students take to fill the form.
* Geeky students who'll try to disable <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/master/icons/javascript/javascript-original.svg" alt="javascript" width="20" height="20"/> and fill the form.
* Preventing students from getting themselves distracted.
  
# <img src="https://emojipedia-us.s3.amazonaws.com/source/microsoft-teams/337/thinking-face_1f914.png" width="43"/> WHAT NEXT FOR WATCHER -
* Reaching out to schools and teachers to facilitate them with our tech.
* Providing a platform where not only Google Forms but other third party platforms can be secured as well.
* Watcher secures forms via the use of iframes, so as long as a testing form is in the form of a website, it can be secured as well.
* Implementing Zoom SDK to secure not only the exams but the process of learning as well.
* Adding multi-language support and a secure admin panel to eliminate any hassle.
